# General Resources

Anything that doesn't fit with the other topics but are important or applies to more than one.

[Blender](https://www.blender.org) is a 3d tool for moddeling, texturing, shading, video editing and anything around it. Its FOSS _(Free and Open Source Software)_ and has a huge community and loads of plugins to extend its usability. It works great with Unity, which is able to directly convert and use .blend files. You can download it [Here](https://www.blender.org/download/) or get a [stable LTS _(Long Term Support)_ version ](https://www.blender.org/download/lts/). It's also available on Steam but this is not recommended by me as you wont be able to directly open files using double click and Unity will not recognise that Blender is installed. You can counter this by installing Blender via Steam and then again using the download above, but changing the install location to the location within Steam. Cool, all that hassle so you can track your time wasted. 

[Unity hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) can be used to install other unity versions, [specifically version 19.3.15f1 here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) although the [LTS Version of 2019.4 might work fine](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases?version=2019.4) and should feature a darkmode.

You might want these [texture assets](https://mega.nz/file/1igmHKRA#nQrRN6IYNLHMNAJv3VI33-q8PIV1X5kU_L6kbhBCLlI) _(From GT version 1.0.4)_
`nQrRN6IYNLHMNAJv3VI33-q8PIV1X5kU_L6kbhBCLlI` if you need the decription key. _(Thanks kpmaxo#6988)_

Idk why you'd need this but here are the default GT speed multipliers and maxes:

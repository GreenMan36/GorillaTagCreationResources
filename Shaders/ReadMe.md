# Shader Resources
>Listed from most useful, imo

Some shaders are hosted in this folder. Info about them might come later down in this readme.

[Make and edit materials Using ShaderForge](https://github.com/FreyaHolmer/ShaderForge/archive/refs/heads/sf_1.40_for_unity_2019.x.zip) Copy the contents of the ShaderForge folder into the root of your GT project and make sure to **not overwrite** any files.


[Shader for worldborders](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/813212277833465879/823747034342621204/AlphaDependingDistance_1.shader) Can scroll, use custom textures and tile.

[Scrolling texture shader, follows UV's](https://discord.com/channels/810644499763691540/810663983106621501/837442033055432735), its code so you just need to paste it into a shader file.

[ShadersLab great example shaders](http://www.shaderslab.com/shaders.html) Recommended to check out!

[Generate normals](https://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/) Handy when you need it, GT often doesn't need normals though.
